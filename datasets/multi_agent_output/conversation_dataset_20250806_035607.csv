1,// Unique SQL injection payloads for login bypass and error-based injection,No Effect,"The provided payload does not contain any SQL injection strings or syntax. It is merely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a webpage's structure, styles, and functionality. To perform SQL injection testing, an injectable parameter should be included in the HTTP request with malicious input. For example, ' OR 1=1 --', which can potentially bypass the login process or cause an error-based SQL injection.","To improve the effectiveness of the payload, add a parameter to the URL or data body that contains an SQL injection string such as ' username=admin' OR 1=1 --'. Additionally, try different types of SQL injection techniques like union-based injection, blind SQL injection, and out-of-band SQL injection for comprehensive testing.",200
1,// Please note that these payloads are for educational purposes only and should not be used to perform malicious activities.,No Effect,"This payload does not appear to contain any SQL injection patterns. It is only a normal HTML and JavaScript code, which is being processed as expected.","To test for SQL injection vulnerabilities, you should use SQL injection payloads such as ' OR 1=1 --' or ' UNION SELECT * FROM users --'. However, remember to use these payloads responsibly and only on systems where you have explicit permission.",200
1,1. OR 1=1--,No Effect,"The payload 'OR 1=1--' did not trigger any error or bypass the login, nor did it cause a delay in response time (Time-based SQL Injection). Instead, the server simply responded with the expected HTML content. This payload does not have a meaningful effect on the application's response.","Try using payloads that are more specific to the database and application being tested. For example, you can use known table or column names as part of your payload, such as 'OR 1=user('admin')--'. This might help in identifying vulnerabilities. Additionally, try using Unions and subqueries to retrieve information from other tables or manipulate the query's results.",200

ID' AND 1=1/*' resulted in an error message which indicates that the server encountered a syntax error due to the presence of a comment (/*) in the injected SQL query, making it impossible for the injection attempt to bypass the login successfully. However, this response does provide valuable information about the database structure and errors, which can be used for further exploitation.","To make the payload more effective, remove the comment symbol (/*) or use a different syntax that may not trigger an error but still allow for injection. For instance, try using single quotes instead of double quotes or escape characters for special symbols like ',;'. Also, consider using multiple queries with UNION SELECT statements to extract sensitive information.",200

Since there is no error message or unusual behavior in the response, it seems that the attack was not successful. The reason behind this could be poor encoding, incorrect payload format for this specific application, or insufficient privileges of the user.","To improve the effectiveness of SQL injection payloads, one should thoroughly understand the target application's environment and SQL syntax. Analyzing error messages, response times, and unusual behavior can help identify vulnerabilities. Additionally, utilizing tools like sqlmap, Havij, or Burp Suite can aid in the creation of effective SQL injection payloads.",200
1,6. ID%27%20OR%20PG_SLEEP%285%29--,No Effect,"The payload seems to have no effect on the HTTP response (200 OK) or response time (0.05s). It may be because the application is using parameterized queries, or the input validation is strong enough to prevent SQL injection. In this case, the server didn't sleep for 5 seconds as suggested in the payload.","Try an error-based SQL injection technique by intentionally triggering an error in the SQL query (e.g., using invalid syntax or data types). You can also test for blind SQL injection techniques such as time-based or out-of-band attacks to find more vulnerabilities.",200

The server responded with a specific error message regarding the syntax issue at the point where the injection was attempted, suggesting that this is Error-based SQL Injection.","Since the current payload resulted in an error, modifying it to avoid triggering such errors can improve its effectiveness.

There's no evidence of SQL injection in the given scenario since there are no error messages or unusual behavior indicating an SQL injection vulnerability.,"To improve the payload's effectiveness, try injecting more complex SQL commands that might trigger errors or unexpected behavior.

The server responded with a 200 status code (OK), indicating that the request was processed successfully, suggesting there is no apparent vulnerability here.","To improve the effectiveness of this payload, try modifying it to interact with the login process, such as bypassing authentication or extracting sensitive data.

2,id' OR 1=1/*,Error-based SQL Injection,"The payload 'id' OR 1=1/*' returned an error message indicating a syntax error in the query. The error is near the comment symbol '/*'. This suggests that the server is trying to interpret the comment as part of the SQL command, which it is not supposed to do.","To improve the payload's effectiveness, remove the comment symbol '/*'. Instead, use a payload like 'id' OR 1=1 --. The double dash (--) in MySQL comments out the rest of the line, making it less likely to trigger an error and more likely to bypass security checks.",200
2,ID' AND 1=0/*,Error-based SQL Injection,"The payload 'ID' AND 1=0/*' returned an error message indicating a syntax error in the query, suggesting that the server attempted to execute the SQL injection attempt. No data was leaked or bypassed as the login process failed, but the error message provided valuable information about the SQL structure being used.","To improve the effectiveness of this payload, remove the comment at the end '/*'.

Also, try crafting more complex payloads that involve multiple SQL statements or functions.",200
2,id%27 && %27a%27LIKE%27a%27--,No Effect,"This payload does not provide any meaningful information that could lead to SQL injection due to the use of LIKE operator and a constant string ('a'). It simply checks if the id column contains the letter 'a'. As a result, it does not trigger an error or bypass authentication.","A more effective payload for this scenario would be one that utilizes union operator with a known table and column to extract data from the database.
