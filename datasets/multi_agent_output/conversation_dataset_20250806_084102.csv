1,' OR 1=1 --,ParseError,"1. XSS Reflected (Cross-Site Scripting) - The script tag with the ""innerHTML"" attribute contains user input, which can be manipulated by an attacker to inject malicious scripts and potentially exploit the application or user's browser.

   2. To improve this specific payload: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to ensure that they do not contain any dangerous characters, such as '<', '>', '""', and 'javascript'. Additionally, consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) header in the application to help prevent XSS attacks by specifying which sources are allowed for scripts, styles, and other potentially risky resources.

   3. Improved Payload:

```html
<script>
// Validate user input first
if(validateInput(inputValue)){
    document.getElementById('container').innerHTML = '<div id=""element"">' + inputValue + '</div>';
}else{
    // Return error message or do something else instead of rendering the user-supplied input.
}
</script>
```
In this example, validateInput() is a function that checks for any dangerous characters in the input and returns false if any are found. The payload uses conditional logic to only render the user input if it has been validated as safe.",' OR 1=1 --,,200
