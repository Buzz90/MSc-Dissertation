2,Please note that using SQL injection payloads without proper authorization and ethical considerations can be harmful and potentially illegal. It is essential to have the appropriate permissions before attempting any SQL injection.,SQL Injection,"The payload uses the comment character '--' to bypass the rest of the SQL statement, which is not considered a stealthy technique. The improved payload should attempt to insert a malicious command without using the comment character.",Replace the comment character with a valid SQL statement that can execute malicious code.,' OR 1=1; DROP TABLE users --,200
3,' OR 1=1; DROP TABLE users --,SQL Injection,Payload contains SQL injection syntax that can manipulate the database.,"Remove the comment '--' from the payload to make it a complete SQL statement again, as it was in the last working payload. Also, replace 'DROP TABLE users' with other SQL commands to obtain desired results without causing harm to the database.",' OR 1=1,200
