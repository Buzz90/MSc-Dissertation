It appears to be a programming language, Visual Basic .NET in this case, but it's not used in a context that suggests an attempt at SQL injection.

This indicates that the payload is causing some level of interaction with the backend database, hence it's classified as Error-based SQL Injection.","To improve the effectiveness of this payload, it should be modified to correctly format the password field by including the closing quote ('). For example: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = '' OR 1=1. This modification allows for a condition (OR 1=1) to be added, which could potentially bypass access controls and grant unauthorized access.",200

If the application responds with errors, it might indicate an SQL injection vulnerability.",200
2,vbnet,No Effect,"The provided payload (vbnet) is not a SQL injection payload. SQL injection payloads are typically SQL commands or malicious input designed to exploit vulnerable applications. In this case, the payload 'vbnet' does not contain any SQL syntax, hence no effect on the application was observed.","To improve effectiveness of SQL injection tests, one should use valid SQL injection payloads such as single or double quotes, semi-colons, comment symbols, and known exploits for specific databases.

Error-based SQL injection occurs when an application responds with an error instead of granting unauthorized access or providing sensitive information.","To improve the payload for better effectiveness in this case, you could try a different type of syntax error such as missing parentheses or commas, or use a single quote (') to end the username field and start a new command.

The fact that the HTTP status was 200 and the response time remained consistent also supports this conclusion. However, a Time-based SQL Injection might be detected if there were significant differences in the response times for different payloads.

The payload does not seem to bypass login or allow any unauthorized access either, which rules out Login Bypass. Since the payload does not have any obvious effects, it can be considered as Invalid Payload at this point.

To improve the effectiveness of this payload, you could try using more complex queries that are likely to produce errors (such as SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' OR 1=1 --).
