Explanation:
Since the original payload had no effect, we'll improve upon the last working payload by using the LOAD_FILE() function to load the contents of a file that does not typically exist on the server (in this case '/etc/passwd'). If SQL injection is successful and the server supports this function, it should return the contents of the specified file. If the response contains any part of the file's content, it indicates an SQL injection vulnerability.",Check payload,' OR 1=1 --,200
