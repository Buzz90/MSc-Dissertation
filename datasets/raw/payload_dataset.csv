id' and 1like1/*,200,0.02,Error-based SQL Injection,The response contains an error message indicating a syntax error in the SQL query on line 194 of MySQLHandler.php. The payload used is attempting to bypass the login page by checking if the username is 'admin' and if the IP address is '127.0.0.1' via the WHERE clause with an invalid condition ('id' and 1like1/...). This indicates that the server is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
